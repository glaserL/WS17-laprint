\emph{Abstract} - Education is being reinforced by technology more and more from which students and teachers alike can profit. Even when students are part of or enrolled in one institution, the educational content they consume will most likely be distributed across the web. To improve the quality of a course, these resources should be taken into account as well, e.g. via suggestions to other students. In order to incorporate these sources without relying on traditional ways of identification like user accounts or cookies, browser fingerprinting can be a valuable alternative.

This work examines the recent work that has been done on web fingerprinting technology. Also, their effectiveness and limitations are discussed. Additionally, some of the available fingerprinting technology will be demonstrated and tested in a student-grade webservice. Finally, we envision a possible integration scenario for Learning Analytics.
